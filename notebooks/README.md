# Notebooks directory



The naming is a number and descriptive title separated by hyphens.
You can optionally include the author's initials between the number and title.
For example, `1.0-ssd-create-splits.ipynb`.

`0.0` is used in this sample repository for a data download and organization step that is unique to the datasets used here.
`1.x` represent steps of model development - creating a proper DataModule and LightningModule so that you can start training your model.
`2.x` represent visualization of results
`3.0` represent developing code for inference (where you run a trained model on an unannotated set like in real life)
